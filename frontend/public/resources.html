    <h1>Postural Resources</h1>
    <p>
        Poor posture often stems from modern-day habits like working in front of a computer, slouching on a couch
        while watching TV, or looking down at a smartphone.
        It does not always cause discomfort, but over time it can place excessive strain on muscles, soft tissues and even
        bones, which could eventually lead to, for example, trouble walking or breathing.
